# Mini Library Finder

Developed a comprehensive mini library finder application that fully implements all core requirements while incorporating every optional 'nice-to-have' feature. Designed with an intuitive, user-friendly interface for optimal user experience. I made sure to make use of the starter code given as it helped alot for all requirements. 

# TO RUN THE PROJECT
when you have the project opened in vs-code, install live server from extensions and then right-click while in the index.html file, there you will find "open with live server" click it and the project will run.
